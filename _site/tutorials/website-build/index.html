<h1 id="the-minimal-mistakes-template">The Minimal Mistakes template</h1>

<p>Now I needed a Jekyll template since the default from GitHub Pages seemed a bit simplistic. <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes">Minimal Mistakes</a> came through bigtime. I spent a long time trying to use a different free Jekyll template, but its homepage was kind of dumb-looking and I couldn’t figure out easily how to change it. The fact that Minimal Mistakes had a <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate">quickstart</a> that made the GitHub repo for me was pretty awesome. All I did was take that, git clone it to my local machine, and start making changes! Then I just git commit as normal. It takes a few minutes for the site to update after the GitHub repo updates. It looks easy to change any layouts or settings by simply copying relevant layout or style files from the main Minimal Mistakes repo into my local repo (the local repo’s version overrides the defaults), but I didn’t try that yet.</p>

<p>I initially wanted to make use of the categorization and tagging functionality to separate research, teaching, outreach, etc., and just make one post per topic.  But I couldn’t easily figure out how to make Research, Teaching, and Outreach into site headers as well as blog categories.  I’m sure there is a way to do this, but I found it easier to just remove the fancy, auto-sorting Categories and Tags pages and make new pages with the “simple” layout.  I guess the outcome is fine - this isn’t really a blog anyway - but the search function is pretty limited as it seems to only see blog posts.</p>

<p>I wanted to change the homepage to be something other than the blog posts, since this is mainly a professional website. Minimal Mistakes already had that solved, too: they provide a splash page layout <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/master/docs/_pages/home.md">here</a>. To use this, I put it in _pages/home.md, then deleted index.html in the root directory. I really enjoy that the homepage is primarily photos, but one could also make a home.md with the “simple” layout or whatever.</p>

<h1 id="font-awesome">Font Awesome</h1>

<p>I didn’t know this existed until there was an example in Minimal Mistakes, but <a href="https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&amp;p=2&amp;m=free">Font Awesome</a> is really helpful for making little thumbnails. You should see where these go in the _config.yml file; the base Minimal Mistakes template is already using them. It is important to remember that there are several subclasses, including business (fab) and solid (fas), e.g.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">icon: "fas fa-fw fa-envelope"
icon: "fab fa-fw fa-orcid"</code></pre></figure>

<p>It doesn’t look like ADS has a Font Awesome icon, so I just picked a random one.  But these really go a long way toward making things look professional.</p>
