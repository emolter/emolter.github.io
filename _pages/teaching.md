# Advising

I'm currently advising two undergraduate students, Mallory Helfenbein and Kazem Ayat, on projects related to the rings and small moons of Uranus and Neptune.  Both students are writing first-author papers on their results - stay tuned!

During my Ph.D. I co-advised undergraduate student Erandi Chavez on a project to understand the time evolution of Neptune's clouds and hazes over a 30 year time span. Her two first-author papers that came out of this work show a fascinating correlation between discrete cloud activity in Neptune and the 11-year solar cycle; those are available [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023Icar..40415667C/abstract) and [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023Icar..40115604C/abstract)

During my Ph.D. I served as a peer adviser for first- and second-year grad students in the Berkeley Astronomy Department.

# Climate & Impacts Research Hub

I co-organize Berkeley's [Climate and Impacts Research Hub](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/climatehub/home),  a monthly seminar and discussion group for early-career scientists focused on interdisciplinary research related to climate change impacts, adaptations, and solutions.  We host presentations on diverse topics ranging from "Indigenous Perspectives on Climate-Change-Driven Farm Expansion in the Arctic" to "Satellite Imaging for Identification of Major Methane Leaks."

# Teaching

I've served as a Graduate Student Instructor for courses at both the intro and senior majors' level, including Astro C10: Introduction to General Astronomy, Astro C12: The Planets, and Astro C162: Planetary Astrophysics.

I have shared my passion for the natural sciences with high school students as a volunteer teacher for [Splash at Berkeley](https://berkeley.learningu.org/) and as a panelist for the Branson school's yearly science symposium.


# DEI

As a White man it is my responsibility to take action to make workplaces within academia more welcoming to minoritized individuals. As a member of the Unlearning Racism in the Geosciences ([URGE](https://urgeoscience.org/)) Berkeley chapter, I helped re-design the Berkeley Earth and Planetary Science department's hiring practices and onboarding to be more transparent and equitable. I have also encouraged Indigenous land acknowledgements and intentionally solicited climate-justice speakers for the Climate and Impacts Hub.
