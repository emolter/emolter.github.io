I'm a 6th year PhD student at UC Berkeley, and while my degree will say "Astrophysics", I really sit at the intersection between solar system science and terrestrial climate change research.  My research interests include radiative transfer, atmospheric fluid dynamics, interferometry, the ice giants, planetary rings, Titan, Io, extreme precipitation, and extreme-value statistics. But if you wanted to hear about all that you should've clicked on [Research]({{ site.url }}/research).

I grew up in Cedarburg, Wisconsin and did my undergrad studies at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/), a small undergrad-only liberal arts school in Saint Paul, Minnesota. I don't really have a good origin story for my interest in astronomy and Earth science starting with the words, "ever since I was a kid", the way some people do. What really happened is that I followed my most inspiring teachers: Amit (high school physics), Mr. Cullen (high school math), Ms. Cibik (11th grade English - nonfiction writing - although I hated it at the time), and especially John Cannon (Macalester astronomy). At some point in undergrad I realized I wanted John to be my adviser, which meant I was gonna do galaxies research with him, like it or not. I liked it. I was lucky to receive extremely supportive and caring advising from Nicolas Chamel, Colin Dundas, and Conor Nixon before grad school as well, and working on various projects with them helped me find where my interests truly lay. With such outstanding role models for what a scientist should be, it's no surprise that I value excellence in mentorship and teaching even more highly than excellence in turning the crank on research; you can hear more about how I've started to pay it forward on the [Teaching & Service]({{ site.url }}/teaching) page.


My life-work balance is important to me, and I spend a good portion of the "life" part climbing. During the week you'll find me pulling on plastic in the various gyms in the East Bay Area. On the weekends I'm typically falling off rocks in Tahoe, Bishop, Mickey's Beach, or Auburn Quarry. And for vacation I've slowly been ticking off all the classic climbing destinations in the vast American West: Joe's Valley, Indian Creek, Ten Sleep, Hueco Tanks, Priest Draw, Red Rocks, J Tree, the Homestead, and more to come. Hopefully I'll remember to start blogging some trip photos. I used to be a pretty serious soccer and Ultimate Frisbee player, and I still find time for those occasionally. I'm a big soccer fan; I follow the MLS (MINNESOTA BLACK AND BLUE!) and the Premier League (no real favorite team).
